# 🔭 About Me
I am currently a fourth year computer science student in Deakin University. I am passionate in creating fun interactive programs and web applications, constantly trying to improve the efficiency and quality of my projects.

I have experience in the languages:
- Python
- HTML
- C++
- C#
- Visual Basic
- CSS

However, I excel the most at python and HTML, with the majority of my personal projects using the two. I have used the other languages during uni, however cannot share my projects due to academic integrity policies and university regulations.
